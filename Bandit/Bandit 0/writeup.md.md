# OVERTHEWIRE-BANDIT0:

Username: bandit0

password: <Redacted>(obtain it from the website)

#### 

#### Prerequisites:



**SSH command:** the SSH command allows for an SSH connection to be established to another computer. SSH is short for Secure Shell; as the name suggests the connection is encrypted and protects against eavesdropping.

Â 

Syntax- *ssh username@computerIwanttologinto.org*



For OverTheWire you will need to know how to specify the port, do that by adding the -p flag(a flag is hyphen follow by a letter to signify a change is the commands parameters/function).



**WSL/VM/Ubuntu/Linux:** To run Linux you will need either a WSL, VM, or Linux operating system. Bellow are explanations of their differences and links to videos highlighting how to install them. It is normal if you encounter many problems while trying to install. If you do encounter one I recommend consulting ChatGpt, but definitely try to solve the problem as it will get you more acquainted with errors and bugs that could occur in any system. If at any point you try to run a command using one of these but it doesn't work also ask Chatgpt you may need to install a package(group of commands).



WSL: Abbreviation of Windows Subsystem for Linux, it allows you to run the Linux terminal in your own terminal, and access your own windows files although that does require slightly different syntax, thankfully you wont have to worry about that until OverTheWire Leviathan. I would recommend installing Ubuntu as it's the most beginner friendly Linux system.

(you only need to watch up until about 2 mins)



VM: A VM is short for Virtual Machine. It simulates the Linux operating system and requires you to allocate resources to it. It can be quite inconvenient to use a VM for Bandit although I would recommend it for Leviathan later. The freedom a VM provides isn't really beginner friendly, but it can be nice to try it out. I would recommend installing ubuntu along with the VM as the OS of choice.

Ubuntu: Ubuntu is a type of Linux system that is very beginner friendly and easy to use. It can even be installed in the Microsoft store and so this method is the simplest and fastest way to start Bandit. I recommend this and I will personally be using it while doing Bandit.



Ubuntu: As I mentioned just go to the Microsoft store :).



Linux: The Linux operating system is what allows us to use bash script to solve bandit and all other OverTheWire wargames. I would heavily advise against uninstalling windows to install Linux, but you could also choose to dual-boot, although I still don't recommend doing this until you have a good grasp of what you can do with Linux. You may find the tutorials confusing; if you do, you probably don't have enough experience and should just stick to one of the other methods.

#### Solving the level:

Open the Ubuntu shell and run the command: *ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220*

afterwards it will ask you for a password, enter the password from the website

Side Note: I have hidden my username so only ~$ will appear before the command on my screen, it's fine if your username appears.
