#### Important things about doing Bandit:



You should NOT depend on this writeup for solutions. The thing that you gain the most from Bandit is learning how to research and deal with frustration.



Instead of using this write-up, you can:



**official website**- Check the commands you may need.



**Use the man command**- Simply putting this command followed by any other command will give you a page explaining what that command does 

(man otherCommand)



**ChatGPT**- not to give you a solution, just to check your syntax



You also should not spend too much time on a level. If your research isn't paying off and you have spent too much time on a level, then check the prerequisites in this write-up. If that still doesn't help you, then you can check the write-up, and if that doesn't work, then finally look for a YouTube video covering that level.
