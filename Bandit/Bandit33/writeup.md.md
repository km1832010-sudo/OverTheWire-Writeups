CONGRATULATIONS!!!



You finished bandit. Take a small break and celebrate. Next, you can do either Krypton(cryptography), Leviathan(reverse-engineering), or Natas(web-exploitation). If you truly completed Bandit without relying on guides, you now have a strong base for the rest of your career. It is recommended to make a write-up about the levels, but it can be a lot less detailed than this one. You also don't have to publish it.
